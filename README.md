## Task 01: Population Distribution Visualization

This project was completed as part of the SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship.

The main objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a population variable using appropriate charts such as a bar chart or histogram.

## Methodology

To complete this task, Python was used in Google Colab. 
A simple dataset representing the gender distribution of a population was created.
The Matplotlib library was used to visualize the data in the form of a bar chart.

The chart clearly represents the number of males and females in the population, making it easy to understand the distribution.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two categories:
- Male
- Female

Each category represents the count of individuals in the population.

## Visualization

A bar chart was generated to show the comparison between different population groups.
Bar charts are effective for comparing categorical data and provide a clear visual interpretation.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib
- GitHub

## Conclusion

This task helped in understanding how data visualization techniques can be used to represent population data effectively. 
Visualizing data using charts makes analysis simpler and more intuitive.

The bar chart was created using Python in Google Colab.
The complete implementation is available in the uploaded notebook file.
